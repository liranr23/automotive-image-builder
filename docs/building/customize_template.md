# Customize the OSbuild templates

Currently our manifests include a number of variables. If you open one of the
OSbuild template manifest,they will appear near the top on the `mpp-vars` section.

It may look like:
```
  "mpp-vars": {
    "rootfs_uuid": {"mpp-format-string": "{__import__('uuid').uuid1()}"},
    "bootfs_uuid": {"mpp-format-string": "{__import__('uuid').uuid1()}"},
    "rootfs_size": 4294967296,
    "homefs_size": {"mpp-format-string": "{rootfs_size}"}
  },
```

We have four variables defined here: `rootfs_uuid`, `bootfs_uuid`, `rootfs_size`
and `homefs_size`.

* The first two are dynamically generated by running the equivalent of the following
  python code:

```python
    import uuid
    uuid.uuid1()
```

* The third one is hardcoded to `4294967296` bytes.

* The fourth one is made equal to the third one.


You then have two ways to tweak these variables. You can either:

* directly edit the template and set their respected values

* specify the variable to the `osbuild-mpp` tool using the `-D` argument
  (see `--help` for more information)
